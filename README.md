# BU-EC500-Deep-Learing-Project
## Introduction
This repository is a the course project for EC500K1 "Deep Learning". We developed two convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten Chinese sentences ('/charactor classifier') and classify them into different categories by semantic ('/semantic classifier'), respectively. The project reports is available under the root folder.
### Branch
The image_seg branch is for image segmentation.<br/>
### Folder
The version #1 is using Matlab to do segmentation. But it could not segment the characters correctly. <br/>
The Sentence_Segmentation is the final version of segmentation which is done by Python.
